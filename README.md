## Steps to setup the application

- git clone https://github.com/donunobunjo/bingHR.git
- composer install
- create a database "binghr_db"
- php artisan migrate:refresh --seed
I seeded the employee table with 3 records just to checkout if i am on track things and to populate the landing page.

## Constraits

My major connstrait was time, I had some personal issue I had to deal with over the weekend. I couldn't implement the roles module(read, write and delete permissions) because of time constraits. I implemented the UI though. The top navigation bar was also not implemented.


Thanks for the oppourtunity
